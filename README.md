# Restriction-programming
Two short proyects about restrictions. One is a Sudoku solver, the other one is the SEND+MORE = MONEY puzzle.

## Organization

### Sudoku solver
There is a dir called `boards/` in which you have different options of sudokus, from various categories (soft to "impossible").
If you want to change the board you just change the name on the following code line `16   archivo = open('./boards/<nameOfTheBoard>.txt', 'r')`.

### Send more money puzzle
You just run te program with `python3 send+more.py` (make sure to openned terminal on folder's path).

## Notes
- [ ] Remember what the code of both programs does
- [ ] (FUTURE) improve it (graphically, optimization, etc)
